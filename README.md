## What the Extension Does

-   Adds a "Search on Nyaa" Button to Anime and Manga pages
    -   Sites: **[MyAnimeList](https://i.imgur.com/1hymaOS.png), [AniList](https://i.imgur.com/DtNugQF.png), [Kitsu](https://i.imgur.com/TVKqRcK.png), [Anime-Planet](https://i.imgur.com/zohAYbs.png), [AnimeNewsNetwork](https://i.imgur.com/xOYS17r.png), [AniDB](https://i.imgur.com/pRDcUVh.png), [LiveChart](https://imgur.com/plZxpBN)**
-   Search Parameters can be changed and saved in the [Extension Popup window](https://i.imgur.com/bzaChNf.png)

    -   For Manga pages, the Category setting will search for the "Literature" equivalent
    -   All tabs with a supported website currently open will automatically refresh on Save

-   By default the search will include both the Japanese(Romaji) & English titles â€” if they exist, and they are different
    -   the search will also add the base titles, if they include: ("Season"|"Part"|": "|" - ")
        -   for example, clicking the button on [Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38524/Shingeki_no_Kyojin_Season_3_Part_2) will return the search query:
        -   _"Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2"|"Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2"|"Shingeki no Kyojin"|"Attack on Titan"_
    -   _**additional "Query" types are available**: the Default combines both "Exact" and "Base"._
        -   Fuzzy: Searches for the site's default title only, without quotes ~ allows fuzzy matching
        -   Exact: Japanese and English full titles ~ searches for exact title names as written
        -   Base: Japanese and English base titles ~ searches with Seasons and Parts removed
