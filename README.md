## What the Extension Does

-   Adds a "Search on Nyaa" Button to Anime and Manga database pages
    -   Individual: **[MyAnimeList](https://i.imgur.com/IXJ7XuK.png), [AniList](https://i.imgur.com/9xhFu5q.jpeg), [Anime-Planet](https://i.imgur.com/sGsl0Bw.png), [AnimeNewsNetwork](https://i.imgur.com/xXvJXHC.png), [LiveChart](https://i.imgur.com/VyIWtLC.png), [AniDB](https://i.imgur.com/DqSkmOg.jpeg), [Kitsu](https://i.imgur.com/CN2kh4C.jpeg)**
    -   Card-type: _**MyAnimeList** ([Season](https://i.imgur.com/7M4hr0z.png), [Genre](https://i.imgur.com/SklbImH.png)), **LiveChart** ([Season](https://i.imgur.com/wvLOp8N.jpeg), [Franchises](https://i.imgur.com/wcNv1JC.jpeg))_
-   Extension settings can be customized and saved in the [Extension Popup window](https://i.imgur.com/Ezz4S6x.png)

    -   The primary settings page is used to change Nyaa search parameters
        -   For Manga pages, the Category setting will search for the "Literature" equivalent
    -   The secondary page is used to change extension behavior _(accessed by clicking the cog icon)_
        -   The Hotkey can be used to activate the button _(even when "Hide Button" is enabled)_
    -   All browser tabs containing a supported website will refresh after pressing the save button

-   Additional Query types are available: _"Default" combines "Exact" and "Base"_.

    -   Fuzzy: Searches for the site's default title only, without quotes ~ allows fuzzy matching
    -   Exact: Japanese and English full titles ~ searches for exact title names as written
    -   Base: Japanese and English base titles ~ searches with Seasons and Parts removed

-   "Default" search example: clicking the button on [Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2](https://myanimelist.net/anime/38524/Shingeki_no_Kyojin_Season_3_Part_2) will search Nyaa for:
    -   _"Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2"|"Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2"|"Shingeki no Kyojin"|"Attack on Titan"_
